# CertificateManagement
Repository for automatic HTTPS Certificate Management. Idea will be to grab a certificate from LetsEncrypt and then push the certificate to various systems:
- SSH to Linux for use with HAProxy
- VMware vCenter
- VMware ESXi hosts
Written in PowerShell, will be fully tested using Windows Server 2019.
